# Hi there 👋

**Software Developer — Problem Solver — Lifelong Learner**

I love designing systems, building interactive experiences, and solving challenging problems.  
Right now, I’m actively expanding my skills and looking for a **developer role** where I can contribute, learn, and grow.

## 🎯 What I’m Focused On

- 💼 **Landing my first full-time software developer role**  
  I’m excited to work on real products, collaborate with great teams, and continue improving every day.

- 🧩 **LeetCode-Solutions**  
Regular practice to sharpen algortihms & data structures skills.

- 🎮 **Ballstacle**
  A skill-based obstacle game I’m building from the ground up.  
  It’s where I explore gameplay programming, clean architecture, rapid iteration, and level design.
